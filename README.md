## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Hedgehog | 2023.1.1 or later
- JDK 17
- Android SDK with API level 34
- Device or emulator with camera support (for photo search)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/schalklotz/WhoDaParking.git
   cd WhoDaParking
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**
   - Launch Android Studio
   - Choose "Open an existing project"
   - Select the `WhoDaParking` folder

3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

4. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew test
   ./gradlew connectedAndroidTest  # Requires connected device/emulator
   ```

5. **Install on device**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew installDebug
   ```

### Vehicle Data Setup

The app reads vehicle data from `app/src/main/assets/vehicle_records.json`. This file contains an array of vehicle records with the following schema:

```json
[
  {
    "Derivco Staff": "John Doe",
    "Vehicle MAKE": "Toyota",
    "Vehicle COLOUR": "White",
    "Vehicle REG": "ABC123GP"
  },
  {
    "Derivco Staff": "Jane Smith", 
    "Vehicle MAKE": "Honda",
    "Vehicle COLOUR": null,
    "Vehicle REG": "DEF456GP/GHI789GP"
  }
]
```

**Field Details:**
- `Derivco Staff`: Staff member name (string)
- `Vehicle MAKE`: Vehicle manufacturer (string)
- `Vehicle COLOUR`: Vehicle color (string or null)
- `Vehicle REG`: License plate(s) - supports multiple plates separated by `/`

**To update vehicle data:**
1. Replace the content of `app/src/main/assets/vehicle_records.json`
2. Rebuild and reinstall the app
3. The app will automatically load the new data on startup

## Usage

### Text Search
1. Open the app and ensure you're on the "Search by Text" tab
2. Enter a license plate number in the text field
3. Tap "Search" to find matching vehicles
4. View results showing staff name, vehicle make, color, and registration

### Camera Search
1. Switch to the "Search by Photo" tab
2. Grant camera permission when prompted
3. Point camera at a license plate and tap the capture button
4. The app will automatically detect and extract text from the photo
5. Edit the detected text if needed, then tap "Confirm & Search"
6. View results same as text search

### Data Normalization Rules

The app normalizes license plates for consistent matching:

1. **Convert to uppercase**: `abc123gp` â†’ `ABC123GP`
2. **Remove spaces and hyphens**: `AB C-1 23GP` â†’ `ABC123GP`
3. **Split multiple registrations**: `ABC123GP/DEF456GP` â†’ `[ABC123GP, DEF456GP]`
4. **Trim whitespace**: `  ABC123GP  ` â†’ `ABC123GP`

Both input and stored registrations follow these rules for matching.

## OCR Tips

For best OCR results when using camera search:

- **Good lighting**: Ensure the license plate is well-lit
- **Stable positioning**: Hold the device steady
- **Appropriate distance**: 1-3 feet from the plate works best
- **Clean plates**: Dirty or damaged plates may not scan well
- **Minimal angle**: Try to photograph plates straight-on

## Privacy & Security

- **No network calls**: All processing happens on-device
- **No data collection**: The app doesn't collect or transmit any personal data
- **Local storage only**: Vehicle data stays in the app's assets
- **Camera permissions**: Only requested when using camera features
- **No analytics**: No usage tracking or analytics are collected

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**App crashes on startup**
- Check that `vehicle_records.json` exists in `app/src/main/assets/`
- Verify the JSON format is valid
- Check logcat for specific error messages

**OCR not detecting plates**
- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Try different angles and distances
- Clean the camera lens
- Verify camera permissions are granted

**No search results found**
- Check that the plate exists in your vehicle data
- Verify normalization hasn't changed the format
- Try enabling fuzzy matching for slight variations

**Build failures**
- Ensure you're using JDK 17
- Clear Gradle cache: `./gradlew clean`
- Invalidate Android Studio caches: File â†’ Invalidate and Restart

### Logs

Enable debug logging to troubleshoot issues:

```bash
# View app logs
adb logcat -s WhoDaParking
```

The app uses Timber for structured logging in debug builds.
